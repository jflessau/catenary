Chat web app built with leptos in rust. Users are grouped by location and velocity. Therefore users in e.g. the same train, bus, subway, etc. can chat with each other.

Still a WIP.

## Development

### Server side rendering

Install [cargo-leptos](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-leptos) with `cargo install --locked cargo-leptos`.  
Then use `cargo leptos watch` to start the server.
