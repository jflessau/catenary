Chat web app built with [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/) in Rust.
Users can see messages dispatched by other users who are near them and traveling in a similar direction at a comparable speed.

Use case: Chat with other passengers on a train, tram, bus, ferry, etc.

Still a work in progress.

## Development

Install [cargo-leptos](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-leptos) with `cargo install --locked cargo-leptos`.
Then use cargo leptos watch to start the server.
